    "This study investigates the impact of environmental conditions, temporal patterns, and geographic distribution on the frequency of car crashes in Chicago during 2018. By analyzing these factors, our research aims to uncover patterns that could inform traffic management strategies and contribute to road safety improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Patterns**: Research indicates that the timing of car accidents can vary significantly depending on the day of the week and time of day. A comprehensive study from Dropplr suggests that the highest frequency of accidents occurred during the afternoon rush hours of 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, with Fridays being particularly prone to collisions<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). This pattern raises questions about the role of traffic volume and driver behavior at these times, which our study will explore further.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environmental Conditions**: Previous studies have shown that weather conditions play a significant role in road safety. For instance, Kaggle Chicago Car Crashes Data Analysis found that overcast and partially cloudy weather during spring and early summer resulted in the highest rate of car crashes with fixed objects, pedestrians, and angle collisions being the categories with more severe accidents<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geographic Distribution**: Our research will also examine how the geographic location within Chicago impacts the likelihood of car crashes. We hypothesize that different areas within the city may exhibit varied crash rates due to factors such as road design, traffic volume, and local enforcement of traffic laws. Understanding the spatial distribution of accidents can help identify high-risk areas, guiding targeted interventions and safety improvements. By mapping accident data across Chicago, we aim to pinpoint where the highest concentrations of accidents occur and analyze potential underlying causes related to the geographic characteristics of these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chicago’s Traffic Safety Efforts**: Kaggle Chicago Car Crashes Data Analysis found out that the key factors of causing road accidents are: issues of yielding right of way, tailgating, overtaking, not adjusting speed, and improper backing maneuvers<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). The city’s ongoing traffic safety initiatives, including the Vision Zero plan, aim to reduce traffic fatalities by addressing factors like vehicle speed and reckless driving<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). Our study will examine how these efforts have possibly influenced accident rates and the persistence of high-risk zones throughout the city.\n",

    "- We hypothesize that in Chicago from 2016 to 2024, the rate of car crashes was significantly higher during periods of snowfall and in areas with inadequate lighting. Due to the compounded adverse effects of reduced visibility and traction, we predict that more crashes would occur during these specific conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We hypothesize that in Chicago from 2016 to 2024, the rate of car crashes was significantly higher during the evening hours, on weekends and holidays. This increase can be attributed to higher road congestion as people are more likely to be going out, alongside an increase in impaired driving due to alcohol consumption during these times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We hypothesize that in Chicago from 2016 to 2024, the likelihood of car crashes was significantly higher near the on and off ramps of highways and freeways, where frequent merging and diverging traffic increases the potential for accidents. Additionally, areas with higher traffic volumes and intersections with complex traffic patterns may also exhibit a higher incidence of crashes.\n"

Some important variables are the crash day, time and location, weather and road condition details, and information about the parties/individuals involved.  These can help us determine what factors have the biggest impact on the type of crash and its severity. The data cleaning process will mostly include understanding or getting rid of NaN values and converting dates and times to numerics or all the same type, resulting in a more focused dataset with 13 key variables.
